Fast Image Recognition can also be used in transport and navigation. 
One benefit of this is for self driving cars to recognise when there are cars in front of the vehicle or when there is a pedestrian crossing the street.
A limitation of fast image recognition in this sector is bad weather which could potentially tamper with the sensors and cameras used to recognise objects.
